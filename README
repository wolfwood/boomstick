Bake is a dependency manager for XOmB.

Inspired by our love of git and the D language's import mechanism, the XOmB crew has long desired to reinvent the way we manage our software.

The core of bake is a dependency rewite engine that works on graphs, with an accompanying serialization language based on the GraphViz dot format.


The goal of bake is to unify dependency management (conditional building and execution of software) across several traditionally isolated phases of the software lifecycle, including:

*) host build environment - fetching, building and configuring the xomb build environment on a non-xomb host (cross compilers, binutils, foreign build tools, and possibly foreign package managers)
 and also rebuilding these tools when customizations (like our newlib stubs) change. only build language toolchains for those languages currently used to build the OS

*) XOmB kernel and executable build tool - 32 binary-only dss and waf's python dependency make us sad.  tools should be easy to run on XOmB as well as host

*) OS image production - build bootable ISO and XOmB native environment (embeddedfs)

*) bootstrapping XOmB native development - ability to identify, produce and include networked and no-net dependencies sets to allow native use of bake

*) XOmB native development - 

*) init scripts - system boot up also involves executing processes with dependencies.  would be especially nice to build fresh copies of services that have been updated


Secondary goals:

*) parallelism - use all my cores without artificially siloing different phases of the build 

*) minimizing dependency set - bake should be able to build as many of its own dependencies as possible

*) easy-mode package integration - allow opaque use of make, cmake etc. for easy porting of external code

*) automatice dependency extraction - easy migration path to bake native building of external projects

*) git integration - use git for package management metadata as well as source code.  allow expression of dependencies in terms of git revisions
